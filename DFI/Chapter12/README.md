# Validation & Procedures

## Test Plan
A systematic approach to testing a system such as a machine or software. The plan typically contains a detailed understanding of what the eventual workflow will be.

### DS Test Plan
1. Scope of the plan
    - Testing version
    - Testing manufacturer
2. How often will the test be redone?
3. Create a baseline for test
    - Manufacturer details
    - Make, model, different flash versions
4. Establish base parameters for tool
    - Known issues, bugs, limitation
5. Evaluate your base parameters against manufacturer
6. Run rest image of baseline
    - Archive test image and version of tool
7. Compare results with tool manufacturer if available
8. Repeat process and note differences


## Question
- What are the limitations of my test
- What are the baseline parameters
- How can I confirm my results

## Why
- Validation for court
- Validation for SOP
- Good communication with tool manufacturer
- Peace of mind for examiner
- Repeatable results

## Cross Validation
An approach by which the sets of scientific data generated using 2 or more methods are critically assessed. Comparing results between 2 or more forensic programs.

1. Acquire device with forensic program
2. Record results
3. Acquire device with another forensic program
4. Record results
5. Compare results

> Repeat all steps for each new release of a forensic program.

In order to validate your software/hardware properly, you must set up a set of rules or procedures that are followed by each employee, officer, investigator etc.

The procedures that you follow to perform validation should be encased within your company's Standard Operating Procedures.
