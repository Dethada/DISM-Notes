## Identifying Digital Evidence

**Digital evidence** can be any information stored or transmitted in digital form.
- U.S. courts accept digital evidence as physical evidence. Digital data is treated as a tangible object.
- Groups such as the **Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE)** set standards for recovering, preserving, and examining digital evidence

**General tasks investigators perform when working with digital evidence**
- Identify digital information or artifacts that can be used as evidence
- Collect, preserve, and document evidence
- Analyze, identify, and organize evidence
- Rebuild evidence or repeat a situation to verify that the results can be reproduced reliably

Collecting digital devices and processing a criminal or incident scene must be done systematically

## Rules of Evidence
- Consistent practices help verify your work and enhance your credibility
- Comply with your state’s rules of evidence or with the Federal Rules of Evidence
- Evidence admitted in a criminal case can be used in a civil suit, and vice versa
- Keep current on the latest rulings and directives on collecting, processing, storing, and admitting digital evidence

- Digital evidence is unlike other physical evidence because it can be changed more easily
    - The only way to detect these changes is to compare the original data with a duplicate
- Most courts have interpreted computer records as hearsay evidence
    - Hearsay is secondhand or indirect evidence

- Business-record exception allows "records of regularly conducted activity," such as business memos, reports, records, or data compilations
- Generally, digital records are considered admissible if they qualify as a business record
- Computer records are usually divided into **Computer-generated records** and **Computer-stored records**

- Computer and digitally stored records must be shown to be authentic and trustworthy to be admitted into evidence
- Computer-generated records are considered authentic if the program that created the output is functioning correctly usually considered an exception to hearsay rule
- Collecting evidence according to the proper steps of evidence control helps ensure that the computer evidence is authentic

- When attorneys challenge digital evidence they often raise the issue of whether computer-generated records were altered or damaged
- One test to prove that computer-stored records are authentic is to demonstrate that a specific person created the records. Eg. The author of a Microsoft Word document can be identified by using file metadata

- The process of establishing digital evidence’s trustworthiness originated with written documents and the "best evidence rule"
- Best evidence rule states:
    - To prove the content of a written document, recording, or photograph, ordinarily the original writing, recording, or photograph is required
    - Allow a duplicate instead of originals when it is produced by the same impression as the original

- As long as bit-stream copies of data are created and maintained properly the copies can be admitted in court, although they aren’t considered best evidence
- Example of not being able to use original evidence
    - Investigations involving network servers
    - Removing a server from the network to acquire evidence data could cause harm to a business or its owner, who might be an innocent bystander to a crime or civil wrong

**The five properties that evidence must have in order to be useful**
- Admissible
- Authentic
- Complete
- Reliable
- Believable

## Collecting Evidence in Private-Sector Incident Scenes
- Typically, businesses have inventory databases of computer hardware and software which help identify the computer forensics tools needed to analyze a policy violation and the best way to conduct the analysis
- Corporate policy statement about misuse of digital assets
    - Allows corporate investigators to conduct covert surveillance with little or no cause
    - And access company systems without a warrant

- Companies should display a warning banner and publish a policy stating that they reserve the right to inspect computing assets at will
- Corporate investigators should know under what circumstances they can examine an employee’s computer. Every organization must have a well-defined process describing when an investigation can be initiated

- If a corporate investigator finds that an employee is committing or has committed a crime. Employer can file a criminal complaint with the police
- Employers are usually interested in enforcing company policy. Not seeking out and prosecuting employees
- Corporate investigators are, therefore, primarily concerned with protecting company assets

- If you discover evidence of a crime during a company policy investigation
    - Determine whether the incident meets the elements of criminal law
    - Inform management of the incident
    - Stop your investigation to make sure you don’t violate Fourth Amendment restrictions on obtaining evidence
    - Work with the corporate attorney on how to respond to a police request for more information

## Processing Law Enforcement Crime Scenes
- You must be familiar with criminal rules of search and seizure
- You should also understand how a search warrant works and what to do when you process one
- Law enforcement officer may search for and seize criminal evidence only with probable cause. Refers to the standard specifying whether a police officer has the right to make an arrest, conduct a personal or property search, or obtain a warrant for arrest

- With probable cause, a police officer can obtain a search warrant from a judge. That authorizes a search and seizure of specific evidence related to the criminal complaint
- The Fourth Amendment states that only warrants "particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized" can be issued

## Understanding Concepts and Terms Used in Warrants

**Innocent information** - Unrelated information often included with the evidence you’re trying to recover

Judges often issue a **limiting phrase** to the warrant which allows the police to separate innocent information from evidence

**Plain view doctrine**
- Objects falling in plain view of an officer who has the right to be in position to have that view are subject to seizure without a warrant and may be introduced in evidence
- Three criteria must be met:
    - Officer is where he or she has a legal right to be
    - Ordinary senses must not be enhanced by advanced technology in any way
    - Any discovery must be by chance

The plain view doctrine’s applicability in the digital forensics world is being rejected.

Example - In a case where police were searching a computer for evidence related to illegal drug trafficking, if an examiner observes an .avi file and find child pornography, he must get an additional warrant or an expansion of the existing warrant to continue the search for child pornography

## Preparing for a Search
Preparing for a computer search and seizure, probably the most important step in computing investigations

To perform these tasks you might need to get answers from the victim and an informant who could be a police detective assigned to the case, a law enforcement witness, or a manager or coworker of the person of interest to the investigation

## Identifying the Nature of the Case
When you’re assigned a digital investigation case Start by identifying the nature of the case Including whether it involves the private or public sector

The nature of the case dictates how you proceed And what types of assets or resources you need to use in the investigation

## Identifying the Type of OS or Digital Device
For law enforcement this step might be difficult because the crime scene isn’t controlled

If you can identify the OS or device, estimate the size of the drive on the suspect’s computer and how many devices to process at the scene

Determine which OSs and hardware are involved

## Determining Whether You Can Seize Computers and Digital Devices
- The type of case and location of the evidence determine whether you can remove digital evidence
- Law enforcement investigators need a warrant to remove computers from a crime scene and transport them to a lab
- If removing the computers will irreparably harm a business the computers should not be taken offsite

If you aren’t allowed to take the computers to your lab determine the resources you need to acquire digital evidence and which tools can speed data acquisition

**Additional complications**
- Files stored offsite that are accessed remotely
- Availability of cloud storage, which can’t be located physically
- Stored on drives where data from many other subscribers might be stored

## Using Additional Technical Expertise
- Determine whether you need specialized help to process the incident or crime scene
- You may need to look for specialists in [OSs, RAID servers, Databases]
- Finding the right person can be a challenge
- Educate specialists in investigative techniques to prevent evidence damage

## Determining the Tools you need
- Prepare tools using incident and crime scene information
- Create an initial-response field kit should be lightweight and easy to transport
- Create an extensive-response field kit which includes all tools you can afford to take to the field. When at the scene, extract only those items you need to acquire evidence

## Preparing to Acquire Digital Evidence
The evidence you acquire at the scene depends on the nature of the case and the alleged crime or violation.
**Ask your supervisor or senior forensics examiner in your organization the following questions**
- Do you need to take the entire computer and all peripherals and media in the immediate area?
- How are you going to protect the computer and media while transporting them to your lab?
- Is the computer powered on when you arrive?
- Is the suspect you’re investigating in the immediate area of the computer?
- Is it possible the suspect damaged or destroyed the computer, peripherals, or media?
- Will you have to separate the suspect from the computer?

## Processing an Incident or Crime Scene
- Keep a journal to document your activities
- Secure the scene
    - Be professional and courteous with onlookers
    - Remove people who are not part of the investigation
- Take video and still recordings of the area around the computer and pay attention to details
- Sketch the incident or crime scene
- Check state of computers as soon as possible
- Don’t cut electrical power to a running system unless it’s an older Windows 9x or MS-DOS system
- Save data from current applications as safely as possible
- Record all active windows or shell sessions
- Make notes of everything you do when copying data from a live suspect computer
- Close applications and shut down the computer
- Bag and tag the evidence, following these steps:
    - Assign one person to collect and log all evidence
    - Tag all evidence you collect with the current date and time, serial numbers or unique features, make and model, and the name of the person who collected it
    - Maintain two separate logs of collected evidence
    - Maintain constant control of the collected evidence and the crime or incident scene
- Look for information related to the investigation: Passwords, passphrases, PINs, bank accounts
- Collect documentation and media related to the investigation: Hardware, software, backup media, documentation, manuals

## Processing Data Centers with RAID Systems
**Sparse acquisition**
- Technique for extracting evidence from large systems
- Extracts only data related to evidence for your case from allocated files and minimizes how much data you need to analyze

**Drawbacks**
- It doesn’t recover data in free or slack space

## Using a Technical Advisor
**A technical advisor can help**
- List the tools you need to process the incident or crime scene
- Guide you about where to locate data and helping you extract log records or other evidence from large RAID servers
- Create the search warrant by itemizing what you need for the warrant

**Responsibilities**
- Know all aspects of the seized system
- Direct investigator handling sensitive material
- Help secure the scene
- Help document the planning strategy
- Conduct ad hoc trainings
- Document activities
- Help conduct the search and seizure

## Documenting Evidence in the Lab
- Record your activities and findings as you work maintain a journal to record the steps you take as you process evidence
- Your goal is to be able to reproduce the same results when you or another investigator repeat the steps you took to collect evidence
- A journal serves as a reference that documents the methods you used to process digital evidence

## Processing and Handling Digital Evidence
Maintain the integrity of digital evidence in the lab as you do when collecting it in the field

**Steps to create image files**
- Copy all image files to a large drive
- Start your forensics tool to analyze the evidence
- Run an MD5 or SHA-1 hashing algorithm on the image files to get a digital hash
- Secure the original media in an evidence locker

## Storing Digital Evidence
The media you use to store digital evidence usually depends on how long you need to keep it.

CDs, DVDs, DVD-Rs, DVD+Rs, or DVD-RWs The ideal media
- Capacity: up to 17 GB
- Lifespan: 2 to 5 years

Magnetic tapes - 4-mm DAT
- Capacity: 40 to 72 GB
- Lifespan: 30 years
- Costs: drive: $400 to $800; tape: $40

Super Digital Linear Tape (Super-DLT or SDLT)
Specifically designed for large RAID data backups
Can store more than 1 TB of data

Smaller external SDLT drives can connect to a workstation through a SCSI card. 

Don’t rely on one media storage method to preserve your evidence make two copies of every image to prevent data loss and use different tools to create the two images.

## Evidence Retention and Media Storage Needs
- To help maintain the chain of custody for digital evidence Restrict access to lab and evidence storage area
- Lab should have a sign-in roster for all visitors and maintain logs for a period based on legal requirements
- You might need to retain evidence indefinitely check with your local prosecuting attorney’s office or state laws to make sure you’re in compliance

## Documenting Evidence
Create or use an evidence custody form

An evidence custody form serves the following functions:
- Identifies the evidence
- Identifies who has handled the evidence
- Lists dates and times the evidence was handled

You can add more information to your form such as a section listing MD5 and SHA-1 hash values

Include any detailed information you might need to reference

Evidence bags also include labels or evidence forms you can use to document your evidence. Use antistatic bags for electronic components

## Obtaining a Digital Hash

**Three rules for forensic hashes**
- You can’t predict the hash value of a file or device
- No two hash values can be the same
- If anything changes in the file or device, the hash value must change

**Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**
Mathematical algorithm that determines whether a file’s contents have changed
Not considered a forensic hashing algorithm.

**Message Digest 5 (MD5)**
Mathematical formula that translates a file into a hexadecimal code value, or a hash value. If a bit or byte in the file changes, it alters the hash value, which can be used to verify a file or drive has not been tampered with.

**Secure Hash Algorithm version 1 (SHA-1)**
A newer hashing algorithm
Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

## Reviewing a Case

**General tasks you perform in any computer forensics case**
- Identify the case requirements
- Plan your investigation
- Conduct the investigation
- Complete the case report
- Critique the case
